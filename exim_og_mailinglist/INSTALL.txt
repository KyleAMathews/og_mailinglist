These files are for integrating OG Mailinglist with the EXIM MTA.

# Installation Instructions (Only tested on Debian/Ubuntu systems, documentation for other systems is welcome).
1. Copy this entire folder to /etc/exim4/
2. Copy 950_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_router to /etc/exim4/conf.d/router/950_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_router
3. Copy 95_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_transport to /etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/95_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_transport
4. Create a file in the /etc/exim4/exim_og_mailinglist directory called site_info.php. Model it after the code below. Add an array item for each site that your server is receiving emails for.
5. Run dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config (Debain/Ubuntu - is there an equivalent command on other OSs?) and ensure that the "Other destinations for which mail is accepted:" or "local domains" setting includes your site's domain name. Otherwise, Exim will simply reject emails directed to this domain.
6. Restart exim by running "/etc/init.d/exim4 restart". Note that on some operating systems like Debian, you need to run "update-exim4.conf" to actually update the configuration before restarting.  See your installation's Exim documentation for specifics.
7. Test setup by sending email to a test group's email on your site e.g. test-group@yoursite.com

Debugging help for when things don't work:
While SSHed into your server, run "tail -f /var/log/exim/mainlog" to see that emails are actually reaching your server and that the og_mailinglist router/transports are being called.
Also, it might help to look at the Drupal logs.


sites_info.php:
<?php

/*
 * @return array of sites w/ associated POST urls.
 */
function og_mailinglist_site_info() {
  return array (
    'eduglu.com' => array(
            'post_url' => 'http://eduglu.com/og_mailinglist',
            'validation_string' => 'get this from /admin/settings/og_mailinglist and paste here',
           ),
    'anothersite.com' => array(
            'post_url' => 'http://anothersite.com/og_mailinglist',
            'validation_string' => 'get this from /admin/settings/og_mailinglist and paste here',
           ),
